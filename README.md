I created a detailed 3D visualization of an indoor concert stage using Autodesk 3ds Max. The project was based on a real-world scenario and involved interpreting client requirements, researching competitor designs, and exploring modern lighting technologies. I also focused on finding effective digital design solutions that would work in a live event setting. This work reflects the growing need in the event industry for realistic spatial visualizations that help plan both the technical setup and the overall look and feel of a stage before itâ€™s physically built.
